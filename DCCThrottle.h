 *    DCCThrottle is a class for abstracting the particulars of a locomotive, train, or consist.
 *    It provides state information on the item's address, speed, direction, functions, and any
 *    consist it may belong to. This class is used as an itermediary between the Layout Control
 *    But (LCB) and the DCC outputs. The handling of translating LCB requests and commands into
 *    DCCThrottle objects is the purview of classed derived from the DCCThrottleManager abstract
 *    base class.
